Graphics:

The main figure: two neurons embedded in a circuit 

two small graphs: (overlaying on axons of two neurons) spike emission of two neurons

one small graph: spike emissions overlapped, to emphasize correlation


and some of these:

 a sample of reconstructed neuron

 spiking patterns of three target cell types that we are going to compare (adaptation and bursting quality)

 a graph showing the increase in correlation after increase in common input >> then 5min text should be modified

 a graph showing the main finding of De la Rocha, increase in correlation after increase in firing rate >> then 5min text should be modified



Texts:

common and independent inputs (in a box overlaying on one of two neurons, indicating the rationale behind our technique )
